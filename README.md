# networks_a3
This repo started as an assignment for a computer networks class. The goal here is to extend the assignment into a more robust networking application.

Possible project ideas:
* Scrap this and use C sockets for torrent client project
* SFTP server and client
* IRC chat?
* Some type of media server clone (e.g Plex, Emby, Jellyfin)
* A toy VPN server
* Websockets implementation
* mDNS browser? (RFC 6762)
* A networked game server (hive or chess?)
* simply make this asynchronous?
* DNS server
* redis server?
* kafka implementation?
* http server?
